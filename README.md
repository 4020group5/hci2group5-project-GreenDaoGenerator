HCI 2 Group 5 Project - GreenDao Generator
====================================

This eclipse project will generate Java code for the DAO classes used in our project.

More information can be found on GreenDAO website: http://greendao-orm.com/documentation/modelling-entities/   
But for our busy developers, you can get an overview & 照猫画虎 here: [GreenDaoGenerator.java](/src/hci2/group5/project/greenDaoGenerator/GreenDaoGenerator.java) :D

This is an normal Java project, so run it as a Java application (not Android). `ctrl+f11` in eclipse will work. :D

Also, when importing this project, make sure this project directory and our main project share the same parent directory or workspace
